"""Ask GitHub whether a newer release of FSO Stats has been published.

This is the *application* version check. `fsostats.update` is the
unrelated thing that fetches newly-posted frames from aceshigh.events -
different job, different server, and the two must not be confused.

What this sends: one anonymous HTTPS GET to the public GitHub releases
API. No pilot name, no database contents, no machine identifier, no
telemetry of any kind - the request carries a User-Agent naming the app
and its version and nothing else. Nothing is collected, stored, or sent
anywhere as a result of the check.

It is deliberately best-effort. No network, GitHub down or rate-limited
(60 anonymous calls an hour per IP), a tag that doesn't parse, a
malformed response - all of it resolves to "no update known", silently.
An update check that interrupts the app to complain it couldn't run is
worse than no update check.

The app never downloads or installs anything. The most it does is offer
to open the release page in the user's browser.
