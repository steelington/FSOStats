"""Colour palette, shared with AHSTATS (E:\\AHSTATS ahstats/theme.py).

The palette came from hitechcreations.com's own site CSS, so both apps
read as companions to the game's website rather than generic dark-mode
tools. Keep the two in step - if one changes, change both.

**Every colour here is a `(light, dark)` pair.** That is customtkinter's
own convention: hand a CTk widget a two-tuple and it picks the right
half for the current appearance mode, and re-picks it - live, on widgets
already on screen - when the mode changes.

The rest of the app is not so lucky. tkinter's Canvas, Listbox and
ttk.Treeview take one flat colour string, so anything drawing on those
must resolve the pair itself with `color()` **at draw time**, and
re-draw when the mode changes. `set_mode()` handles the ttk styling and
then calls back everything registered through `on_mode_change()`.
